h2. Introduction.

*This project is not rocket science and does not push the boundaries of current technology.*

My initial intention was to create a professional looking CV/resum&eacute; using a nice theme template
that I discovered on themeforest.com named Clean CV. Rather than just updating the Word version of my
CV I wanted to show prospective clients that I have a solid grasp of web development. It also gave me
an excuse to re-visit Ruby and Rails, and checkout the current landscape.

I wanted to use as many variations of model associations/relationships as possible to make it as
realistic as possible (a common frustration with technology demos is they often aren't), so there are
1 to 1, 1 to many and many to many relationships. The object graph is sufficiently complex as to be
realistic.
