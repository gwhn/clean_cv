h2. Introduction

This application allows registered users to manage their CVs, and guests to search and browse them. The initial intention was to create a professional looking CV/resum&eacute; using a theme template I discovered on themeforest.com, called Clean CV. Rather than just updating the Word version of my CV, I wanted to show prospective clients that I have a solid grasp of the _latest_ web development techniques. It also gave me an excuse to play with Ruby and Rails, and check-out the current gem/plugin landscape.

I have adopted techniques for progressive enhancement to enable dynamic features where the browser's capabilities allow it. This way, user's with the latest browsers get the best experience, but older browsers can still access _all_ the apps functionality. To achieve this, the app uses a technique known as Unobtrusive JavaScript, which separates behaviour from markup, in the same way it is best practice to keep style separate to markup using CSS. This is particularly pertinent at this time (Sep 2010) as the browsers adopt the HTML 5 specification differently.

h2. Dependencies

All the necessary gems are unpacked in the vendor directory except mysql and rmagick which need to be installed.

h2. Model Associations

I wanted to use all variations of model associations/relationships as possible to make it more realistic (a common frustration with technology demos is they often aren't), so there are 1 to 1, 1 to many, and many to many relationships.

h2. Features

# Uses Devise for authentication, which is Rack based, uses Warden and is extremely modular
# Uses Declarative Authorization for role-based authorization, which provides a DSL to write authorization rules at both controller and model level
# Registered users can manage any number of CVs that they create
# Unregistered users can search and browse all CVs by name, email and job title (more search filters to come)
# Uses Paperclip to allow registered users to upload a photo for each CV, but doesn't require it
# Uses ImageMagick to create 100x100px thumbnail of uploaded photo, which is centered regardless of the original's aspect ratio
# Uses PDFKit, which in turn uses WebKit's wkhtmltopdf to dynamically generate PDFs on the fly
# Allows users to add links to the Flickr, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter accounts
# Allows users to add a link to a Google map of their location
# Progressively enhances functionality dependent on the browser's capabilities
# Everything still works when JavaScript is switched off
# Everything looks reasonable in IE7 (IE6- users should expect things to look crap if they use crap)
# Work experience and education are displayed in date descending order
# Only the first project listed for each company is displayed by default to reduce information overload
# Uses Google Visualization area chart to provide a timeline of the number of months for each year spent with each company
# Person skills, company responsibilities and project tasks can be re-positioned using drag and drop (when polymorphic notes are implemented, I intend to allow drag and drop between models as well as scopes)
# Skills can be associated with projects for quick lookup
# Uses JQuery UI with the Aristo theme, if JavaScript is enabled, to display and post forms using AJAX with submit buttons removed from the form and replaced in the button panel for consistency
# Skills are summarized by category for quick lookup
# Uses Uniform with the Aristo theme to provide a quality, consistent look and feel to file upload, checkbox, radio and select input controls
# Allows nested attributes in forms with parent-child relationships i.e. when creating a person, you can add work experience, skills and schools which offers a more natural workflow
# Disables nested attributes if JavaScript is not enabled
# Uses the new data-xxx attributes of HTML 5 to add new child associations to models
# Uses SASS and blueprint to help manage styles
# Uses the latest HTML 5 boilerplate template

h2. Future Improvements

p.
 Initially I had responsibilities associated with projects, but decided that they were really
 related to the company, not the project. I added tasks to projects but the data structure was
 exactly the same, consisting of id, timestamps, description and position (for ordered listing).
 I now realize that I could have used a polymorphic relationship, named the association note(s)
 and added them to company and project instead. This could then be taken further and applied to
 any of the other models i.e. skill.notes or category.note
